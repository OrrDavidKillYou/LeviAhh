        <h1>History of Pizza</h1>

        <h2>Ancient origins</h2>
        <p>Flatbreads with toppings existed in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Greece, and Rome. They were simple, often just herbs and oils.</p>

        <h2>Modern pizza</h2>
        <p>Pizza as we know it started in Naples, Italy in the 18th–19th centuries. It was a street food for the poor, often topped with tomatoes, cheese, oil, and sometimes anchovies.</p>

        <h2>Margherita pizza</h2>
        <p>In 1889, a pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil was named Pizza Margherita after Queen Margherita of Italy, representing the colors of the Italian flag.</p>

        <h2>Spread worldwide</h2>
        <p>Italian immigrants brought pizza to the U.S. in the late 19th century. It became popular in cities like New York and Chicago, evolving into styles like New York thin crust and Chicago deep-dish.</p>
